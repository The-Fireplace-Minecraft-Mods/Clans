# Clans - A server-side land protection mod

Clans adds a command-based land claiming and protection system to Fabric servers. It is a server-side only mod, so
players do not have to install the mod to join your server and use it. See
the [CurseForge page](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/clans) for more details.

This mod can be used with [Grand Economy](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/grand-economy) to charge players for
creating a clan or claiming land.

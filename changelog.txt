Additions:

Changes:
Opclan claim commands can now be used to force claims in dimensions that aren't normally allowed.
Map commands are now faster and are now based on sections of the map instead of generating one centered on the player.
A player's cooldown for /clan home will now count down even if the player is offline
The raid reward "multiplier" is now being renamed to the clan's "weakness factor" since it isn't necessarily a multiplier anymore, just a factor that server owners can adjust on winning and losing and use in their formulas.
Players that are OP can no longer use opclan commands if they've been denied access by a permission manager

Fixes/Internal Changes:
Massively improved performance of just about everything the mod does
Fixed a bug in the message clan members get when someone leaves the clan
Fixed a crash when all raiders or clan members log out before a raid activates
Fixed /opclan setname not changing the name
Fixed claim data failing to save when there are a lot of claimed chunks
Removed the ability for addons to attach generic data to clan data
Economy-related commands will no longer register if Sponge is present without an actual economy present
Fix Win-Loss ratio attempting to divide by 0 for players that haven't lost
Clan save data is now stored more efficiently and takes up less space
